## Task 11, Day 5 `XXE` SOC-mas XX-what-ee?

**XXE** - XML External Entity
**DTD** - Document Type Definition
More than just calling out document language when coding a page, can also use to ensure certain attributes will always be included moving forward. DTD for address book may be:  
~~~
<!DOCTYPE people [
    <!ELEMENT people(name, address, email, phone)>
    <!ELEMENT name (#PCDATA)>
    <!ELEMENT address (#PCDATA)>
    <!ELEMENT email (#PCDATA)>
    <!ELEMENT phone (#PCDATA)>
]>  
~~~  

`<!ELEMENT>` defines the tags that are allowed, `#PCDATA` stands for parsed data/plain text. Can call out external files or resources with `<!ELEMENT ext SYSTEM "<file-path/as-url/file-name>">`.

When a web application processes an XML file with an external entity, the parser tries to load or execute the resource. If not sanitized properly it could reveal sensitive information or be redirected to malicious code.  

For this operation, using Burp Suite to intercept requests using the in app browser and the repeater to send command payloads to browse beyond the website.  

### Lessons Learned
Primary fix is for devs to **disable external entity loading** in the xml parser. In PHP this can be done by setting `libxml_disable_entity_loader(true)` before processing any XML. Secondary is to always **validate and sanitize user input**. This ensures only expected data is processed. Remove suspicious keywords like `/etc/hosts` and `/etc/passwd` from requests.  

### The Task
Find the two flags in the web app.
