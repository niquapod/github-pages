## Task 7, Day 1 `OPSEC` Maybe SOC-mas music, he thought, doesn't come from a store?

Investigating a website, in this case a Youtube to MP3 converter.

#### Issues to be aware of:
- Malvertising: Malicious ads that can exploit vulnerabilities and cause infection
- Phishing scams: fake surveys or offers to harvest personal/sensitive info
- Bundled malware: As described on tin

#### Tests applied: 
1) Download result of conversion and run `file` command against the files
2) Run exiftool on questionable file

Embedded command details:
  - `-ep Bypass -nop` flags disable PS' usual restrictions, allowing scripts to run without interference from security settings or user profiles
  - `DownloadFile` pulls file from remote server and saves to local machine ('download source','target path')
  - `iex` executes file downloaded

3) Search web for unique items in code, check places like GitHub, looking for ideas of who creator is

### The Task
Provide details from files downloaded and GitHub

#### Recommended Stuff
