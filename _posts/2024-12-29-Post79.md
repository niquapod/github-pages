## Task 25, Day 19 `Game hacking` I merely noticed that you're improperly stored, my dear secret!  

Executable may farm out common tasks to libraries to handle. Can use something like Frida to intercept function calls to alter the argument sent or the return value resulting in non-normal operation. Frida allows analyzing, modifying, and interacting with running processes. Creates a thread in the target process that executes some bootstrap code. This interaction (aka agent) permits the injection of JavScript code, controlling the app's behavior in real-time. Interceptor funtion allows altering internal funtions' input or output or observe their behavior.  

### The Task
Use Frida and VSCode to insert JavScript that helps get the flags and unlock the door.

### Recommended Stuff
