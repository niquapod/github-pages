## Task 12, Day 6 `Sandboxes` If you can't find a nice malware to use, I'm not going.  

### Detecting Sandboxes
Often times Windows sandboxes don't have the `C:\Program Files` directory. Can check if it's present by looking in the registry: `HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\ProgramFilesDir`  

Example for checking in C language:  
~~~ C
void registryCheck() {
    const char *registryPath = "HKLM\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion";
    const char *valueName = "ProgramFilesDir";

    \\ Prepare the command string for reg.exe
    char command[512];
    snprintf(command, sizeof(command), "reg query \"%s\" /v %s", registryPath, valueName);

    \\ Run the command
    int result = system(command);

    \\ Check for successful execution
    if (result == 0) {
        printf("Registry query executed successfully.\n");
    } else {
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to execute registy query.\n");
    }
}
int main() {
    const char *flag = "[REDACTED]";
    registryCheck();
        return 0;

}
~~~

### YARA
Tool that identifies and classifies malware based on patterns in its code. Sample YARA rule for detecting any command that tries to access the registry:  

~~~
rule SANDBOXDETECTED
{
    meta:
        description = "Detects the sandbox by querying the registry key for Program Path"
        author = "THM"
        date = "2024-10-08"
        version = "1.1"

    strings:

    $cmd= "Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\" /v ProgramFilesDir" nocase



    condition:
        $cmd
}
~~~

- **Strings** defines variables that include the value to look for.
- **Condition** defines when the rule will match the scanned file. Example is true if any of the above strings are present.

### Adding Evasion Techniques
#### Obfuscation
Consider encoding the command in base64 and running in powershell:  

~~~ c
void registryCheck() {
    const char *encodedCommand = "R2V0LUl0ZW1Qcm9wZXJ0eSAtUGF0aCAiSEtMTTpcU29mdHdhcmVcTWljcm9zb2Z0XFdpbmRvd3NcQ3VycmVudFZlcnNpb24iIC1OYW1lIFByb2dyYW1GaWxlc0Rpcg==";
    
    \\ Prepare the PowerShell execution command
    char command[512];
    snprintf(command, sizeof(command), "powershell -EncodedCommand %s", encodedCommand);

    \\ Run the command
    int result = system(command);

    \\ Check for successful execution
    if (result == 0) {
        printf("Registry query executed successfully.\n");
    } else {
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to execute registy query.\n");
    }
}
~~~

#### Combatting Obfuscation
Can use tools like Floss to scan malware binaries to extract obfuscated strings. Run in powershell to scan file and write output to file: `floss.exe <Path-to-malware\binary.file> |Out-file <path-to-output\file.txt>`  

### Using YARA Rules on Sysmon Logs
**Sysmon** is from Sysinternals, continuously monitors and logs system activity across reboots. Provides detailed event data on process creation, network connections, and file changes. Set filter to logs with XLM looking for EventRecordID from one of the intial YARA tests. Go to details of event in Event Viewer. Valuable `EventData`:  
- `ParentImage` parent process that spawned cmd process to check registry.
- `ParentProcessId` and `ProcessId` valuable for follow up and searching other logs for related events.
- `User` helps determine what privileges were applied when running command. May identify a hidden account used to run commands.
- `CommandLine` details about the command that was run.
- `UtcTime` Provides solid time frame to keep the timeline straight.  

### The Task
Retrieve flags from malware via EDR and Floss.
